            <hr>
            <p>
                Information Technology became a vital and integral part of XXI century life. From multi-national corporations to small companies, everyone these days is using IT for business. The presence of the computers in business can best be determined by looking on how it is being used in all over the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Lets show some examples:</strong><br />
                Communication between employees, Suppliers and customers. For many companies, emails is the principal means of communication between employees, suppliers and customers. Using voip, email, text, video and audio live chats is a must have in XXI century businesses.

            <p>
                <strong>Inventory management Systems:</strong><br />
                Inventory Management Systems track the quantity of each item that company maintains, triggering and order for additional stock when the quantities fall below a pre-determined amount. To get best results these inventory management systems should be connected to the point-of-sale (POS) system which ensures that each time an item is sold, that item is removed from the inventory count creating a closed information loop between all departments.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Data Management Systems:</strong><br />
                Nowadays companies stores digital versions of their files on servers and storage devices. These files are instantly available to everyone in the company, regardless on their geographical location. Companies are able to store tremendous amount of historical data and employees benefit from immediate access to the document they need.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Management information systems:</strong><br />
                MIS is a computer based system which is created for organisation (i.e. managers) to organise and evaluate information and data and provide information in a timely and efficient manner. This also helps managers to analyse and make decisions based on the information and analysis that MIS provides.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Customer Relationship Management:</strong><br />
                CRM is an approach to manage a company’s relationship with current or potential customer. It uses data analysis about customer’s history with a company to improve business relationship with customers, specifically focusing on customer retention and ultimately driving sales growth.

            <hr>

            <p>
                All team members must have minimum basic IT skills, willingness to learn and very good communication skills. Ability to work as part of a team is essential as well as positive attitude and open minded personalities is also recommended. Proper planning and using desirable software must be implemented from the beginning. For example, using Slack for communication between team members, sharing ideas and files, anytime - anywhere, and Trello board (Kanban method) software for preparing a list of “to do, doing and done” where team members will create a plan of every step of their project. Splitting jobs between members of the team especially by finding strong abilities of each person and also their weaknesses will help the team to assign each part of the project to the best person. Results of the entire project is dependant on tiny bits of the planning, making, managing time, team working, error checking and testing.

                <strong>Planing website should be well prepared from the beginning.</strong><br />
                Using Trello (originated from Kanban (Japanese 看板 - signboard or bilboard) a web-based list-making application where user is able to plan a list of “to do, doing and done” tasks. Thanks to graphics interface work items are visualised to give participants a view of progress and process. This part is mostly essential to proper planning each step of preparing and doing process. Below there is a link to my Trello board: <a href="https://trello.com/b/L6YD1c97/websiteproject">websiteproject</a>

            </h2>
            <hr>

            <p>
                As every project we need to bear in mind that not everything might go as we planned. Even a well planned project might struggle with problems. One of the risks leading to fail the project might be human error (i.e. lack of experience in IT), computer interruption/failure (virus or malware, software crash, hardware overheating or permanently crashing as a result of ) or poor team cooperation. Misinterpretation of project assumption might also lead to project failure.

                Due to the specification of CodeNation course Develop: Coding we were designated to use MacBook Pro 13” (2017) 2.3 GHz Intel Core i5 , 16 GB 2133MHz LPDDR3 with Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640 1536MB macOS Mojave 10.14.5 We are using Slack, Trello, Visual Studio Code. As for previous Coffee Shop iOS app project this configuration seems to be not powerful enough, but for the web design should be sufficient.

            <p>
                For this specific project I am using Trello board to make a written plan for each step of my work i.e. “To do-doing-done”, text editor for making this text document, Visual Studio Code for coding in HTML & CSS, internet for finding helpful sources like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">w3schools</a> and content for entire work.

            <hr>

            <p>
                When preparing for this project I realise that using Trello board is very useful in terms of planning project from earliest stages, implementing ideas through board, managing time for each part of the project. From early planning, throughout implementing ideas, to the very end of the project thanks to the Trello and its ability to change the content and position of each board at any time.

                <strong>Git and GitHub:</strong><br />
                Git is a distributed version-control for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers but it can be used to track changes within any set of files. Github is an American company that provides hosting for software development version control using GIT. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of GIT as well as its own functionality.

            <hr>

            <p>
                GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation and was created by EU as regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individual citizens go the European Union (EU) and The European Economic Area (EEA)
            </p>

            <p>
                GDPR aims primarily to give control to European citizens to control over their personal data and to simplify law for international businesses by unifying the regulations within EU. Those individuals or companies who’s not restrict GDPR regulations, might be fined up to 4% of their global revenue or 20 million Euros, whichever is greater.
            </p>

            <p>
                In short term under this regulation no one should use other individual or company personal data or intellectual property without consent.
