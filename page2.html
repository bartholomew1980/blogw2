                you happy with the tools you used?

            <p>
                The MacBook Pro which I have used for this project was something new to me. 
                It has an iOS system or great trackpad was something that I loved at the first sight. 
                Using it during a three week course gave me a basic knowledge about  Mac, iOS, 
                Visual Studio Code, Trello. 
                <br><br>
                As a person who’s never use VSC before I can admit that Visual Studio 
                is good for the Blog website project. 
                Coding in html and css in it is a great new experience even with just 
                minimum knowledge about coding. I can admit that the menu of VSC is user friendly. 
                <br><br>
                Using Trello for the first time was also a great experience, the intuitive menu, 
                simple and user friendly UI is an advantage of Trello board. 
                “To do-doing-done” board is something that I will definitely will use for my future projects.
                <br><br>
                The combination of those three features makes for an excellent tool to plan, 
                make changes and work on the project in an effective and user-friendly way.

            <hr>
            <p>
                Compatibility of the Visual Studio Code is one of its greatest options.  
                As a source code editor that can be used with major programming languages is perfect for user multi directories work. 
                Several of them are included, for example JavaStript, TypeStript, CSS art HTML but other language extension might be downloaded form the VS Code Marketplace.  
                It’s versatile and user friendly UI is something that is worth to mention. 
                <br><br>
                Trello is great for planning and making list of “to do-doing and done” due to it’s functionality and simplicity. 
                Ability to make a drag-and-drop tasks list is its core function.  
                Trello is simple and intuitive, either you need to do a project or simple to-do list, it want disappoint you.

                After few days of trying to build simple website I can admit it could do it better. 
                Due to the time restrictions I couldn’t implement more things like animated background, 
                music, or video played straight on the blog in scaled window. 
                <br><br>
                As for simple webpage with menu, static but nice looking background and loads of content, 
                I have to said I am satisfied but my webpage is far away from perfection. 
                It is just a simple example of how to use HTML and CSS I was trying to concentrate 
                on content and to find appropriate sources for blog to be published.

                Collecting appropriate content for the blog was one of two mail goals for this project. 
                Doing researches was quite interesting as were the subjects. 
                After reading all of the sources I had write the content for blog. 
                Editing and formatting techniques which a have used include some help from google translate 
                to make sure that there is no misspelling and words i have used are gramatically correct.
