                    <hr>
                    <p>
                        From the early years I was interested with computers.
                        I had Commodore 64, Amiga 600 and 1200, early PC 286 25MHz, 
                        through few generations of Pentium, until I7 which I am using 
                        currently. 
                        <br>
                        
                        I have finished IT school with a diploma as 
                        IT Technician back in Poland in 2005.
                        For few years I used to work in PC shop configuring and building 
                        computers for clients individual orders. 
                        After years of absence in IT industry I have decided to back 
                        on the track.
                        <br>

                        In 2018 I have accomplished College on 
                        ICT Systems and Principles for IT Professionals
                        (MTA -  Microsoft Technology Associate) 
                        <br> 
                        But even without working full time in the IT I have continuously repairing, 
                        configuring and helping people to keep their computers up to date. 
                        As soon I heard about Code Nation courses I decided to catch this opportunity 
                        and gain new interesting skills in IT.  
                        I am flexible, willing to learn new skills and bilingual.
