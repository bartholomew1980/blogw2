            <hr>
            <p>
                For creating this blog I have used simple layout using numbered points for each question, 
                paragraphs, bold text and links to present references.  Main background is a picture of butterfly 
                which I’ve made last weekend.  
                <br>
                Answering for each question in the best possible way using simple but understandable language. 
                Finding content resources over the internet I was trying to describe them in my own words where it was possible. In some parts of content,  
                some of the technical informations had to remain this same so some parts of the content is very similar to its original sources.

            <p>
                As for this project none of the copyrights were breached. 
                I have used my own macro picture of butterfly and can admit it hasn’t been hurt in any way.

                Unfortunately these days copyright law in many places over the internet is breached in a various ways.  
                For example in the European Union there is a regulation named The General Protection Regulation (GDPR) 
                which have been implemented into action in the 2018. This regulation is standing towards respecting copyright law
                and private data protection. 
                <br><br>
                Copyright protection attaches to an original work, for example:
                <br>
                <p1>Literature - articles, computer software, smartphone apps, essays, poems, novels. 
                <br>
                Music - lyrics,  musical notes, melodies, operas, musical plays. 
                <br>
                Sound recordings - recorded speeches, cd, podcasts  etc. 
                <br>
                Audio-visual - television shows, movies, online videos , video games, slideshows. 
                <br>
                Art - photographs, graphics, sculptures, maps, diagrams, fine arts. 
                <br>
                Architectural - plans and drawings associated with it.

                 - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h2>

                There is few group of people with special needs in terms of getting access to the internet and websites. 
                One group are people with sight problems i.e. colour blinds, where high contrast, large, simple fonts are extremely important to help them surfing over the web.  
                Talking web pages and text-to-speech are also very useful. 
                <br>
                Other group are people with hearing problems where i.e. subtitles in the movies ore the only way to understand the content. 
                No one should be excluded form access to the internet resources and websites, so this is a great opportunity for IT community to help people without it
